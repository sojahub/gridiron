# EVM with Gridiron Ethereum

Gridiron Ethereum offers an improved EVM experience that goes beyond the basic implementation of Ethereum.
In addition to the reliable and consistent Ethereum functionality, Gridiron Ethereum offers developers the 
creation of stateful precompiles & custom modules that developers can use to create more efficient and 
powerful smart contracts.

## Additional Features

The Gridiron Ethereum offers several additional features to enhance the EVM experience, 
including stateful precompiles, and custom opcodes. In this documentation we will discuss
these features in the context of a Cosmos-SDK based chain.

### Stateful Precompiles
Stateful precompiles are precompiled contracts that can alter state on the 
chain, enabling more efficient stateful operations at a lower gas cost. 
The [Precompiles] section provides a more detailed explanation of 
how Gridiron Ethereum uses these precompiled contracts.

### Custom Opcodes

Custom opcodes have been added to Gridiron' EVM implementation to provide additional 
functionality and support for complex smart contracts. However, some of the opcodes 
provided by Ethereum are not compatible with Gridiron' EVM implementation, 
which may affect contracts that use these opcodes. The [Opcode Documentation] 
provides information on these changes.
