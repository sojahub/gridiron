# EVM Tracing

Tracing allows users to examine precisely what was executed by the EVM during some specific event or in the course of a set of transactions.
There are two different types of transactions in the Gridiron Ethereum EVM: value transfers and contract executions. A value transfer simply moves
the base token from one account to another. Whereas a contract interaction executes code stored at a contract address which can include altering 
stored data and transacting multiple times with other contracts and externally-owned accounts. A contract execution transaction can 
therefore be a complicated web of interactions that can be difficult to unpick. The transaction receipt contains a status code that 
shows whether the transaction succeeded or failed, but more detailed information is not readily available, meaning it is very difficult 
to know what a contract execution actually did, what data was modified and which addresses were touched. This is the problem that EVM 
tracing solves. Gridiron Ethereum's interface traces transactions by re-running them locally and collecting data about precisely what was executed by the EVM.

## State Availability

In its simplest form, tracing a transaction entails requesting the Gridiron Ethereum node to reexecute the desired transaction with 
varying degrees of data collection and have it return an aggregated summary. In order for a Gridiron Ethereum node to reexecute a transaction, 
all historical state accessed by the transaction must be available. 

By Default, all Gridiron Ethereum nodes are archval nodes.
It is possible to run a Gridiron Ethereum light client but for EVM tracing, a full node is required.

An archive node retains all historical data back to genesis. It can therefore trace arbitrary transactions at any point in the history of the chain. Tracing a single transaction requires reexecuting all preceding transactions in the same block.

## Types of Tracing



### Basic Traces

Gridiron Ethereum has the ability to produce basic transaction traces in the form of raw EVM opcode traces. These traces contain detailed information about every EVM instruction executed during a transaction, 
such as the opcode name, cost, program counter, remaining gas, error (if any), and execution depth. Additionally, the structured logs can 
include the content of the execution stack, memory, and contract storage, if desired. Example [Coming Soon]().

### Built-in Tracers

The tracing API of Gridiron Ethereum allows the user to specify a tracer parameter, 
which determines how the data returned from the API call should be processed. 
If the tracer parameter is not provided, the default tracer (the struct logger) 
is used. While the default tracer produces raw opcode traces, they can be 
cumbersome and difficult to read for many use cases, and can also be quite 
resource-intensive to process. To address these issues, Gridiron Ethereum includes 
a set of non-default built-in tracers that can be specified in the API 
call to return different types of data. These built-in tracers are Go functions 
that perform specific preprocessing on the trace data 
before returning it.  Example [Coming Soon]().

### Custom Tracers

Besides the built-in tracers, Gridiron Ethereum also allows users to create custom tracers 
that can process and return data from events in the EVM in a more convenient format. 
These custom tracers can be written in either Javascript or Go. Javascript tracers are 
suitable for quick prototyping, experimentation, and less resource-intensive applications. 
In contrast, Go tracers offer better performance, but require compilation with the Geth 
source code. Using custom tracers enables developers to collect only the necessary data 
and perform any processing directly at the source. Examples [Coming Soon]().
