# Using Foundry with Gridiron

<div className="steps-container">

## Introduction

This guide shows how to deploy and interact with smart contracts using foundry
on a local Gridiron Ethereum EVM network.

[Foundry toolchain](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a smart contract
development toolchain written in Rust. It manages your dependencies, compiles
your project, runs tests, deploys, and lets you interact with the chain from the
command-line.

## Recommended Knowledge

- Basic understanding of [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org) and [Cosmos](https://docs.cosmos.network/main).
- Basic understanding of the [Gridiron Ethereum's architecture](../../architecture)
- Basic understanding of [Liquid Staking](https://docs.stride.zone/docs/getting-started-liquid-stake)

## Requirements

- You have [installed
  Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry#installation) and run `foundryup`. This
  installation includes the `forge` and `cast` binaries used in this
  walk-through.
- You have a running instance of Gridiron Ethereum EVM. See [Local Machine](../../running-a-node/running-locally) to run Gridiron Ethereum locally.

## Gridiron Ethereum Liquid Staking Smart Contract Example

### Create A New Project With forge

Let's create a new project called "gridiron-lsd-example" with forge.
`forge init gridiron-lsd-example`

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="gridiron-lsd-example" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="lib">
      <FileTree.Folder name="forge-std" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="script">
      <FileTree.File name="Counter.s.sol" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src">
      <FileTree.File name="Counter.sol" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="test">
      <FileTree.File name="Counter.t.sol" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="foundry.toml" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Add Configurations For Local Gridiron Ethereum

<Callout emoji="💡">
  Ensure that you have a local instance of Gridiron Ethereum Running. See [Local
  Machine](../../running-a-node/running-locally) to run Gridiron Ethereum locally.
</Callout>

You can add a profile to your foundry project by appending the following lines to the end of your foundry.toml file:

```bash
[profile.default]
src = 'src'
out = 'out'
libs = ['lib']

# See more config options https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry/tree/master/config

[profile.gridiron_local]
src = 'src'
out = 'out'
libs = ['lib']
evm_version = 'berlin'
eth_rpc_url = 'http://localhost:8545'
```

To test the configurations above, let's deploy the generated contract in the "Counter.sol" file to the Gridiron Ethereum localnet:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=gridiron_local forge create Counter --private-key=xxxxxxxxxxx
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  - Forge reads the profile's name from the environment variable
  "FOUNDRY_PROFILE". - You should replace `xxxxxxxxxxx` with your own private
  key.
</Callout>

If everything goes well, forge will print out the address of the deployed contract and the transaction hash for the deployment.

### Install Dependencies

We will build the Liquid Staking contract based on [Solmate](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate) contracts.

To install solmate, run the following command:

`forge install transmissions11/solmate`

### Add Remappings.txt

Foundry installs all dependencies as git submodules under the directory of "lib".
And to make it easier to import the dependencies, let's create a `remappings.txt` file with the following contents:

```bash
ds-test/=lib/forge-std/lib/ds-test/src/
forge-std/=lib/forge-std/src/
solmate/=lib/solmate/src/
```

Your file system should now look like this:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="gridiron-lsd-example" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="lib">
      <FileTree.Folder name="forge-std" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="script">
      <FileTree.File name="Counter.s.sol" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src">
      <FileTree.File name="Counter.sol" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="test">
      <FileTree.File name="Counter.t.sol" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="foundry.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="remappings.txt" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Create The Staking Module interface

We need a way of interacting with the staking module. This can be done through the use of an Interface.
More information on Interfaces in Solidity can be found [here](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/solidity-interface#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20Solidity%20interface,and%20functions%20on%20a%20contract.)

Create a new file under the `src` directory called `IStakingModule.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

/**
 * @dev Interface of the staking module's precompiled contract
 */
interface IStakingModule {
    ////////////////////////////////////////// EVENTS /////////////////////////////////////////////

    /**

     * `sourceValidator` to `destinationValidator`

    event Redelegate(

    event CreateValidator(address indexed validator, uint256 amount);

    /**

     */
    event Unbond(address indexed validator, uint256 amount);

    /**

     * unbonding delegation with `validator`
     */
    event CancelUnbondingDelegation(
        address indexed validator,
        address indexed delegator,
        uint256 amount,
        int64 creationHeight
    );

Your file system should now look like this after adding `IStakingModule.sol`:

### Create The Liquid Staking Contract

We are now going to create the Liquid Staking Contract.
Create a new file under the `src` directory called `LiquidStaking.sol` and add the following code:

```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import {IStakingModule} from "../staking.sol";
import {ERC20} from "solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol";

/**
 * @dev LiquidStaking is a contract that allows users to delegate their Base Denom to a validator
 * and receive a liquid staking token in return. The liquid staking token can be redeemed for Base
 * Denom at any time.
 * Note: This is an example of how to delegate Base Denom to a validator.
 * Doing it this way is unsafe since the user can delegate more straight through precomile.
 * And withdraw via the precompile.
 */
contract LiquidStaking is ERC20 {
    // State
    IStakingModule public staking;
    address public validatorAddress;

    // Errors
    error ZeroAddress();
    error ZeroAmount();
    error InvalidValue();

    /**
     * @dev Constructor that sets the staking precompile address and the validator address.
     * @param _name The name of the token.
     * @param _symbol The symbol of the token.
     * @param _stakingprecompile The address of the staking precompile contract.
     * @param _validatorAddress The address of the validator to delegate to.
     */
    constructor(
        string memory _name,
        string memory _symbol,
        address _stakingprecompile,
        address _validatorAddress
    ) ERC20(_name, _symbol, 18) {
        if (_stakingprecompile == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        if (_validatorAddress == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
        staking = IStakingModule(_stakingprecompile);
        validatorAddress = _validatorAddress;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Returns the total amount of assets delegated to the validator.
     * @return amount total amount of assets delegated to the validator.
     */
    function totalDelegated() public view returns (uint256 amount) {
        return staking.getDelegation(address(this), validatorAddress);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Delegates Base Denom to the validator.
     * @param amount amount of Base Denom to delegate.
     */
    function delegate(uint256 amount) public {
        if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();

        // Delegate the amount to the validator.
        staking.delegate(validatorAddress, amount);
        _mint(msg.sender, amount);
    }

    /**
     * @dev Withdraws Base Denom from the validator.
     * @param amount amount of Base Denom to withdraw.
     */
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        if (amount == 0) revert ZeroAmount();
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    }
}
```

Your file system should now look like this after adding `LiquidStaking.sol`:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="gridiron-lsd-example" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="lib">
      <FileTree.Folder name="forge-std" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.Folder name="script">

    </FileTree.Folder>
    <FileTree.File name="foundry.toml" />
    <FileTree.File name="remappings.txt" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Functionality

`LiquidStaking.sol` is a Solidity smart contract that implements a basic liquid staking mechanism,
allowing users to delegate tokens to a validator and receive staked tokens in return.
The key features of the contract are:

- It inherits from the ERC20 token contract, allowing it to be used as a standard fungible token with a name, symbol, and decimal places.
- It takes four arguments in its constructor: the name and symbol of the LSD, the address of [Staking Module Precompile Contract Address](../../precompile-overview), and the address of the validator that the contract will delegate to.
- The `delegate(uint256)` function allows users to delegate an amount of the token to the validator, by calling the `staking.delegate()` function with the same amount of the token transferred as Ether.
- The `withdraw(uint256)` function allows users to withdraw their delegated tokens from the validator, by burning their staked tokens and transferring the same amount of Ether back to the user.
- The `totalDelegated()` function returns the total amount of assets currently delegated to the validator from the contract address.

Overall, this contract allows users to stake their tokens through a validator,
receiving a tokenized version of their stake that can be traded or transferred like any other ERC20 token. _Note_: this is an example and not production code.

### Deploy The Liquid Staking Contract

To deploy your Liquid Staking contract you can run the following script:

<Callout emoji="💡">
  The default staking precompile contract address is
  `0xd9A998CaC66092748FfEc7cFBD155Aae1737C2fF`. More information about
  precompiles can be found [here](../../precompile-overview)
</Callout>

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=gridiron_local forge create src/LiquidStaking.sol:LiquidStaking --private-key=xxxxxxxxxxx --constructor-args  “<name>“ “<symbol>” “<staking_precompiled_contract_address>” “<validator_address>”
```

or you can use a forge script to handle this.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "forge-std/Script.sol";
import "./LiquidStaking.sol";
import "../staking.sol";

contract Deploy is Script {
    LiquidStaking public staking;
    address immutable precompile =
        address(0xd9A998CaC66092748FfEc7cFBD155Aae1737C2fF);
    address public validator = address(0x12); // @dev : Change this to the validator running.

    function run() public {
        vm.startBroadcast();
        staking = new LiquidStaking("name", "SYMB", precompile, validator);
        vm.stopBroadcast();
    }
}
```

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=gridiron_local forge script src/examples/Deploy.s.sol:Deploy --broadcast  --private-key=xxxxxxx --rpc-url=xxxx --gas-limit 10000000
```

If everything goes well, forge will print out the address of the deployed contract and the transaction hash for the deployment.

### Test The Liquid Staking Contract

We can now test our Liquid Staking contract by delegating and receiving
a tokenized version of our stake. To do so, run the following script:

```bash
FOUNDRY_PROFILE=gridiron_local cast send --private-key=xxxxxxxxxxx <deployed_contract_address> ‘delegate()’ 1
```

###  🎉 Congratulations! 🎉

Congratulations! You have successfully created and deployed a Liquid Staking contract on Gridiron Ethereum via Foundry!
