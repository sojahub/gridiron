/**
 * 	Welcome to Stateful Precompiled Contracts! To build a stateful precompile, you must implement
 *  the `StatefulImpl` interface in `interfaces.go`; below are the suggested steps to
 *  follow:
 *	  1) Define a Solidity interface with the methods that you want implemented via a precompile.
 *	  2) Build a Go precompile contract, which implements the interface's methods.
 *       A) This precompile contract should expose the ABI's `Methods`, which can be generated via
 *          Go-Ethereum's abi package. These methods are of type `abi.Method`.
 *   	 B) This precompile contract should also expose the `Method`s. A `Method` includes the
 *          `executable`, which is the direct implementation of a corresponding ABI method, the
 *          `executable`'s `RequiredGas`, and the ABI signature. Do NOT provide the `AbiMethod` as
 *          this field will be automatically populated.

	// AbiSig returns the method's string signature according to the ABI spec.
	// e.g.		function foo(uint32 a, int b) = "foo(uint32,int256)"
	// Note that there are no spaces and variable names in the signature.
	// Also note that "int" is substitute for its canonical representation "int256".

	// ABI method.
